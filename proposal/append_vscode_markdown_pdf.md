I would like to append /plans/... with the following critera; vscode-markdown-pdf [https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf/tree/master] has the right idea. 

I would like this to be a utility and a extension that can be used on all vscode type platforms and programs.

vscode-markdown-pdf meets 70% functions and feature i currently desire. ths would be a great spring board to learn and build from.

obviouse use of sla templates or general xml temlates are still a must.

I would like to create a new plan accordingly.
